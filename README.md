# Feature-Implementation

This is a sample project plan for the following scenario:

A new Virtual Classrooms feature ( https://www.d2l.com/products/virtual-classrooms-video-assignments-premium/) will be rolled out to the UCalgary community, to enable online classrooms to be integrated into D2L courses.


As the Learning Technologies Administrator, you will need to plan the activation and configuration of that feature within our D2L environment. We would like to see a mini project plan - what steps would you take to learn about the feature? Who would you collaborate with to develop a plan? How would you identify and approach stakeholders to learn about their needs? How would you plan the activation, configuration, testing, and documentation of the new feature?



Note - the feature is not actually being adopted at this time, so you aren’t being asked to develop a comprehensive plan. We are interested in the process you would use, and how you would communicate that process to the team at the Taylor Institute as well as to key stakeholders in IT and faculties.
